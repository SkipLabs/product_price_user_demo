# Manual API Tests

This file contains curl commands to manually test all the API endpoints for the new tables.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the server is running:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

The server should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸš€ Quick Test - NEW ProductResource

Here are the key curl commands to test the new ProductResource with price information:

### 1. Start streaming products with prices

```bash
curl -LN http://localhost:3000/streams/products
```

### 2. In another terminal, test the reactive updates

```bash
# Create a product (appears in stream with price: null)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Product", "description": "Testing prices"}'

# Add a price (stream updates with price included)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/product-prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_id": 6, "price": 99.99}'
```

### 3. Test existing products with prices

```bash
# Products 1-5 already have prices from sample data
curl -LN http://localhost:3000/streams/products/1
```

  }'
```

### Update a Product

```bash
# Replace {id} with the actual product ID from the create response
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/products/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Test Widget",
    "description": "An updated test widget"
  }'
```

### NEW: ProductResource Streaming Test Sequence

```bash
# Test the new ProductResource that includes price information

# Terminal 1: Start streaming all products with prices
curl -LN http://localhost:3000/streams/products

# Terminal 2: Create a new product (should appear in stream WITHOUT price initially)
PRODUCT_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Stream Test Product", "description": "Testing real-time streams"}')

PRODUCT_ID=$(echo $PRODUCT_RESPONSE | jq -r '.id')
echo "Created Product ID: $PRODUCT_ID"

# Terminal 2: Add a price to the product (should update in stream WITH price)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/product-prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"product_id\": $PRODUCT_ID, \"price\": 45.99}"

# Terminal 2: Update the price (should reflect in stream)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/product-prices/$(curl -s http://localhost:3000/product-prices | jq -r ".[] | select(.product_id == $PRODUCT_ID) | .id") \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"price": 59.99}'

# Terminal 2: Update the product name (should reflect in stream)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/products/$PRODUCT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Updated Stream Test Product with Price"}'
```

### Original Products Streaming Test Sequence

```bash
# Test streaming while making changes to see real-time updates

# Terminal 1: Start streaming all products
curl -LN http://localhost:3000/streams/products

# Terminal 2: Create a new product (you should see this appear in Terminal 1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Stream Test Product", "description": "Testing real-time streams"}'

# Terminal 2: Update the product (you should see this change in Terminal 1)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/products/6 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Updated Stream Test Product"}'

# Terminal 2: Delete the product (you should see this removal in Terminal 1)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/products/6
```

### Test Users with Product Sum Stream

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start streaming users with product sum
curl -LN http://localhost:3000/streams/usersWithProductSum

# Terminal 2: Create a product price to test reactive updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/product-prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_id": 1, "price": 99.99}'

# Terminal 2: Create a user product threshold (should trigger sum recalculation)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/user-product-thresholds \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": 1, "product_id": 1, "upper_threshold": 200.00, "lower_threshold": 20.00}'

# You should see the total_product_value field update in the stream
```

## Expected Responses

### Successful Creation (201 Created)

All POST requests should return the created object with generated `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields.

### Successful Update (200 OK)

All PATCH requests should return the updated object with modified `updated_at` field.

### Successful Deletion (204 No Content)

All DELETE requests should return an empty response with status 204.

### Streaming Responses (301 Redirect)

All streaming endpoints return a 301 redirect to the Skip streaming service URL where you can access real-time data streams.

#### ProductResource Stream Response Format (NEW)

The `products` stream now returns products with price information:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "SuperWidget",
  "description": "The ultimate widget for all your widget needs.",
  "price": 19.99,
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Key Features:**

- `price`: Current price from product_prices table (null if no price set)
- Real-time updates when either product info OR price changes
- Reactive mapping joins products with their prices automatically

#### Users with Product Sum Stream Response Format

The `usersWithProductSum` stream returns users with an additional `total_product_value` field:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "ada_lovelace",
  "email": "countess@analytical-engine.dev",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "total_product_value": 0
}
```

Note: The `total_product_value` field represents the sum of prices for all products that the user has thresholds configured for.

### Error Responses

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request body or missing required fields
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found (for updates/deletes)
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Database or server errors
